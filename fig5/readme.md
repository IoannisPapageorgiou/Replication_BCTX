# Description 

In Figure 5, the statistical significance of the forecasting results of Table 3 is examined by implementing post-hoc Nemenyi tests. 

# Code

The corresponding R code is given in the file 'stat_sig.R', which first loads the results from Table 3, and then implements appropriate statistical significance tests (i.e., post-hoc Nemenyi tests) to create Figure 5. The R package 'tsutils' is used to implement  the Nemenyi tests.
