In Figure 5, the statistical significance of the forecasting results of Table 3 is examined. This is achieved by implementing post-hoc Nemenyi tests using the R package 'tsutils'. 

The corresponding R code is given in the file 'stat_sig.R', which firsts load the results from Table 3, and then implements appropriate statistical significance tests (i.e., post-hoc Nemenyi tests) to create Figure 5.
