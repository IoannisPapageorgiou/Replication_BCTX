In Figure 5, the statistical significance of the forecasting results from Table 3 is examined. This is achieved by implementing post-hoc Nemenyi tests using the R package 'tsutils'. The corresponding R code is given in the file 'stat_sig.R', which firsts loads the results from Table 3 and then implements the statistical significance tests to create Figure 5.
