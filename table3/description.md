The results of Table 3 replicate the forecasting experiment of Table 2 for a large number of major stock market indices, in order to test for statistical significance of the results. 

The code used to generate the results is identical with the corresponding code from Table 2 (see folder 'table2' for these), just applied to more datasets. 

The complete list of the 21 major stock market datasets are contained in the folder 'table3/data' below. Again, the appropriately transformed data are given, so these files can be loaded directly to the C++ and R code, respectively.
