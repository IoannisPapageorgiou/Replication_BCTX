In this folder the results of Table 1 are replicated.

The datasets are in the folder "data" and include: the simulated datasets sim1, sim2, sim3, and the real-world datasets unemp, gnp, ibm. All real-world datasets in this folder contain the transformed (differenced, etc) data, so they just need to be loaded in their exact form.

The folder "bctx" contains the C++ code for the BCT-AR model in the above foecasting experiments.

The folder "bench" contains implementations of the alternative methods in R and Python for the same datasets to be loaded.
