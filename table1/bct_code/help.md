The proposed BCT-X methodology is implemented in C++ for further computational efficiency. A different ".cpp" file is included in each folder which generates the BCT-X forecasting results of the correspnding figure/table; the data read by the C++ code should be at the same directory with the ".cpp" file. This C++ implementation has been built using the linear algebra library 'Eigen' (version 3.3.9, available at: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), which needs to be included as an additional directory.
