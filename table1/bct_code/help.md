This folder contains the C++ code for the BCT-AR model in the experiments of Table 1. For simplicity and ease of preproduction, a different ".cpp" file is given for each dataset, in which all the BCT-AR hyperparameters are already tuned appropriately.

While any standard compiler could be used in order to compile the C++ code from the ".cpp" files, Microsoft Visual Studio is suggested. If Visual Studio is used for creating a project to run the C++ code, the datasets from the folder "table1/data" should also be copied to the corresponding project directory. Every ".cpp" files reads the corresponding dataset in the main function; for example, the file "sim1.txt" that is read in "pred_sim1.cpp" refers to the file in "table1/data/sim1.txt" that should also be copied to Visual Studio project repository.  

This C++ implementation has been built using the linear algebra library 'Eigen' (version 3.3.9, available at: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), which needs to be included as an additional directory. something which is also easy to do in Visual Studio.
