This folder contains the C++ code for the BCT-AR model in the experiments of Table 1. For simplicity and ease of preproduction, a different ".cpp" file is given for each dataset, in which all the BCT-AR hyperparameters are already tuned appropriately. For example, the file "pred_sim1.cpp" can be used directly, without requiring any changes, to reproduce the results for the first simulated dataset, and so on.

While any standard compiler could be used to compile the C++ code from the ".cpp" files, it is suggested to use Microfost's Visual Studio IDE for C++. If Visual Studio is used for creating a project to run the C++ code, the datasets from the folder "table1/data" should also be copied to the corresponding project directory. Every ".cpp" file reads the corresponding dataset in the main function; for example, the file "sim1.txt" that is read in "pred_sim1.cpp" refers to the file in "table1/data/sim1.txt", which should also be copied to Visual Studio project repository.  

Since linear algebra operations were required, this C++ implementation has been built using the linear algebra library 'Eigen' (version 3.3.9), which is available online at: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page. This needs to be included as an additional directory to the project, something which is also easy to do in the Visual Studio environment.
