# Replication package for "The Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model for time series modelling and forecasting"

Ioannis Papageorgiou and Ioannis Kontoyiannis

## Overview and contents

The code in this repository generates the forecasting results in the paper "The Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model for time series modelling and forecasting", and more specifically, those presented in Tables 1-3 and Figure 5.

The main contents of this repository are organised in the following folders:

* table1
* table2
* table3
* fig5

Each one of these folders contains: 

1) The datasets used for the correspnding table/figure
2) The code used to generate the BCT-X forecasting results
3) The code used to generate the forecasting results of alternative methods
